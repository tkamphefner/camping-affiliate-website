The Coleman Evanston Screened Camping Tent offers the perfect balance of spaciousness, protection, and convenience for family camping adventures. Its standout feature is the screened-in porch area, which provides additional protected space for relaxing without being bothered by insects. This versatile area can also serve as extra sleeping space in good weather or storage for camping gear.

The tent's WeatherTec system features patented welded floors and inverted seams to help keep water out during rainy conditions. The sturdy frame is engineered to withstand significant winds, providing stability and peace of mind during changing weather conditions. Setup is straightforward and can be completed in approximately 15 minutes, even for those with limited camping experience.

Inside, the spacious interior can comfortably accommodate up to 6-8 people or two queen-sized airbeds. The mesh roof offers excellent ventilation and allows for stargazing when the weather is clear. When rain threatens, the included rainfly can be quickly attached for additional protection while still maintaining good airflow. Convenient storage pockets help keep small items organized and off the tent floor, while the electrical access port makes it easy to bring power inside for charging devices or running small appliances.

Whether you're planning a weekend getaway or an extended camping trip, the Coleman Evanston provides a comfortable, reliable shelter that combines practical features with thoughtful design.
