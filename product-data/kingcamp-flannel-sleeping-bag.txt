Description: The KingCamp Flannel Sleeping Bag is an extra-wide sleeping bag designed for adults who want more room to move around. It features a comfortable flannel lining that becomes softer after washing and provides good insulation for various weather conditions. The XL size makes it ideal for taller individuals or those who feel restricted in traditional mummy-style sleeping bags. Despite its larger size, it remains relatively lightweight and comes with a compression bag for easier transport during camping trips.
